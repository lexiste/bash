#        - Hardcode location of smbclient, procdump, & wmiexec.py #
#        - Create a target list of valid hosts, separated by      #
#          newline. (Can create with "nmap -p 445" and parsing    #
#          out the host ip addresses)                             #
#        - PoC only set up for 64 bit. You're welcome to change   #
#          the wmic flags if you're hitting a 32bit system.       #
#        - PoC assumes share is C$. Change if you like.           #

USAGE="
Bash script to upload procdump to remote host, dump memory on the remote host, and then download that dump back to the local host.

Flags:
  -u	Username (requires Local Administrator privileges)
  -p	Password
  -d	Domain (use a dot "." for host based authentication)
  -f  File containing IP Addresses or Hostnames of targets. Separated by newline.
  -h	Help text and usage example.

usage:	 grabDump.sh -d <domain> -u <username> -p <password> -f <file of target hosts>
example: grabDump.sh -d GIBSON -u zerocool -p hunter2 -f hostlist.txt
example: grabDump.sh -d . -u Administrator -p Welcome -f hostlist.txt
